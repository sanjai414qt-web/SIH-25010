## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is an AI-driven, voice-enabled mobile platform tailored for small and marginal farmers. It integrates real-time data sources, such as local weather, soil databases, crop calendars, and market prices, to deliver actionable advice in the user’s native language.

Farmers can:

Input or upload data (e.g., images of diseased crops)

Receive crop-specific recommendations

Get alerts for pest outbreaks or extreme weather

Access mandi prices and nearest sale points

Interact via voice if they are unable to read

The solution is adaptive and evolves based on user interaction, agronomic trends, and seasonal patterns. It is also designed to work offline in low-connectivity areas, syncing when internet becomes available.
Innovation and Uniqueness of the Solution

Localized and Personalized: Combines hyperlocal weather and soil data with AI models to deliver personalized advice.

Multilingual + Voice Support: Breaks literacy and language barriers using voice interaction and native language support.

Image-Based Diagnosis: Leverages computer vision for disease and pest detection through image uploads.

Modular Architecture: Scalable across regions and customizable for various crops, seasons, and state-specific schemes.

Farmer-Centric Design: Built with feedback from field-level farmers, ensuring relevance and ease of use.
## Technical Approach
Technologies to be Used:

Front-end: Flutter/React Native (cross-platform mobile app)

Back-end: Node.js, Django (Python-based microservices)

Database: PostgreSQL, Firebase

AI/ML: TensorFlow/PyTorch for pest detection and recommendation systems

NLP & Voice: Google Dialogflow, Bhashini APIs for voice-to-text in Indian languages

APIs: IMD weather data, Soil Health Card APIs, Agmarknet for mandi prices

Methodology & Implementation Flow:

User Onboarding: Farmer registers with basic details (location, crops, land size).

Data Collection: Optional soil report upload, real-time image submission, voice questions.

Analysis Engine: AI models analyze data to provide personalized recommendations.

Advisory Delivery: Crop selection, sowing dates, fertilizers, pest alerts, market rates.

Feedback Loop: Users rate advice; system improves via machine learning.

(Flowcharts and prototype wireframes can be appended as part of the technical annexure.)
## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility:

Technical: Core technologies (voice AI, computer vision, NLP) are mature and adaptable.

Operational: Can be integrated with existing agriculture extension systems.

Financial: Can be developed in phases with government or CSR funding. Potential for public-private partnerships.
Challenges and Mitigation:
Challenge	Strategy
Low digital literacy	Voice-first interface with minimal UI complexity
Trust & adoption	Partner with trusted local NGOs/co-ops for outreach
Connectivity issues	Offline-first app architecture
Data availability	Collaborate with govt for soil/weather datasets
## Impact and Benefits
Target Audience Impact:

Increased crop yield by 20–30% through better decision-making

Reduced input costs by avoiding overuse of fertilizers and pesticides

Increased farmer income and reduction in crop failure-related debt

Broader Benefits:

Social: Digital empowerment of rural communities

Economic: Boost in rural agri-economy

Environmental: Sustainable farming and resource conservation
