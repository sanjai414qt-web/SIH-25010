## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
A smart, AI-powered advisory platform designed for India's smallholder farmers, delivering personalized agricultural guidance via a mobile app or chatbot. The solution leverages AI, local data, and language technologies to ensure accessibility, usability, and impact.

Key Features

AI-driven recommendations for crop planning, fertilizer, and pesticide use.

Multilingual support (initially in Punjabi, Hindi, and English, with scalable architecture).

Voice interface to enable low-literate users to navigate and receive guidance.

Image-based pest and disease diagnostics using machine learning models.

Weather integration for alerting on rain, frost, or heatwaves.

Market price insights for better harvesting and selling decisions.

Two-way communication allowing farmers to ask questions or report issues.

Offline functionality with periodic syncing for low-connectivity areas.

## Technical Approach
Technologies to Be Used

Mobile Application: Flutter / React Native (cross-platform)

Backend: Node.js / Python (FastAPI), PostgreSQL, Firebase

AI/ML Models: TensorFlow / PyTorch (for pest detection, recommendation engines)

Image Analysis: CNN-based models for disease identification

Language and Voice Tech: Google Speech API, Bhashini (Govt. of India language tech stack)

Weather Data: Integration with IMD, OpenWeatherMap APIs

Hosting/Infrastructure: AWS / Google Cloud
Implementation Methodology

Data Collection and Training

Collaborate with agri-research institutions and Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs).

Build training datasets for local pests/diseases.

Prototype Development

Develop MVP with core features.

Pilot in select districts in Punjab.

Feedback & Refinement

Engage with farmer groups for user feedback.

Optimize UI/UX for rural users.

Scaling

Add languages, states, and features based on adoption and feedback.

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility

Technical Feasibility: Proven availability of all technologies; existing datasets and APIs can be leveraged.

Operational Feasibility: Can be rolled out in partnership with agriculture departments and NGOs.

Economic Feasibility: Potential for government funding, CSR support, or public-private partnerships.

## Impact and Benefits
Social Impact

Empowers marginalized farmers with knowledge and confidence.

Promotes inclusivity by overcoming language and literacy barriers.

Economic Impact

Potential to increase yield by 20–30%.

Reduces input costs by optimizing chemical usage.

Improves market access and price realization.

Environmental Impact

Encourages responsible fertilizer and pesticide use.

Protects soil health and reduces contamination.
